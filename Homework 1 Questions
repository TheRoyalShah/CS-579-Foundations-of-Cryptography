Figure 1: A substitution-cipher ciphertext c.
Figure 2: Histogram of English letters.
Problem 1 (40%)
(1) Provide a formal denition for the mono-alphabetic substitution cipher, or simply substitution
cipher, by describing its message space M and the algorithms Gen, Enc and Dec.
(2) Figure 1 depicts a ciphertext c that has been produced by a substitution cipher. Use the
histogram in Figure 2 to successfully decrypt c to the corresponding plaintext m. What is m?
(3) Show that the substitution cipher is trivial to break when the adversary launches a chosen-
plaintext attack. How much chosen plaintext is needed to recover the entire secret key? What is
the shortest chosen single-message plaintext that you can nd, which is a valid English message
and would successfully recover the key?
(4) Under which conditions, if any, and why, is the substitution cipher perfectly secret?
Problem 2 (20%)
(1) Consider the extension of the One-time Pad cipher, where a ciphertext c is possibly longer than
the plaintext m (and the key k) by one bit, namely, by having algorithm Enc append to m k a 0
or 1, with probability 0:65 or 0:3, respectively. Is this extension a perfectly secret cipher and why?
(2) Based on your answer in the previous question, prove or refute the following statement:
An encryption scheme with message spaceMis perfectly secret if and only if, for every
probability distribution DM over M and every c0; c1 2 C, we have that:
Pr[C = c0] = Pr[C = c1] :

Problem 3 (20%)
(1) Show that if 1(n) is a negligible function, then for any positive polynomial p(), the function
2(n) = p(n)  1(n) is also negligible. What does this imply for an attacker that attempts to break
a symmetric cipher by guessing its n-bit secret key k|which is selected by algorithm Gen uniformly
(at random) from all possible keys?
(2) Is (n) negligible, and why, if (a) (n) = n105
2n1=2 or (b) (n) = nô€€€510
105n105 .
Problem 4 (30%)
Consider an encryption scheme  = (Gen; Enc; Dec) that is EAV-secure according to the denition
that has been discussed in class.
(1) What does the condition jm0j = jm1j capture? Does it weaken or strengthen 's security?
(2) Consider the notion of EAV2-security that we get if we remove the above condition jm0j = jm1j,
that is, where in the corresponding security game the adversary A is allowed to choose challenge
messages of arbitrary length for breaking an encryption scheme 0 = (Gen0; Enc0; Dec0) for arbitrary
long massages. Intuitively, 0 is EAV2-secure, if no ecient A can determine cb non-negligibly
better than guessing, even when jm0j 6= jm1j. Show that no EAV2-secure scheme 0 exists.
Hint: First, note that 0 is dened over message space M = f0; 1g, i.e., messages of
arbitrary length. Then, assume that polynomial p() is an upper bound on the time
spent by Enc0 for encrypting a single bit, and consider what happens when A chooses
m0 2 f0; 1g and a random m1 2 f0; 1gp(n)+c, where c  1 a positive integer.
(3) Show that EAV2-security can be achieved by encryption schemes dened over messages up to
a given maximum length, i.e., by schemes 0 such that for k 2 f0; 1gn, algorithm Enc0 is dened
over message space M0 = fm : jmj  `g, where ` , `(n) for some given polynomial `().
Hint: Construct a scheme 0 = (Gen0; Enc0; Dec0) that encrypts messages in M0 by
employing a EAV-secure scheme  = (Gen; Enc; Dec) with message space M. Consider
an algorithm Enc0 that on input message m0 2M0, merely applies Enc on a unique and
inversible encoding m = E(m0) 2Mof m0 in a way that \compensates" for the absence
of the restriction jm0j = jm1j in the original game used to dene EAV-security. Then,
prove that 0 is EAV2-secure via a proof by reduction.
